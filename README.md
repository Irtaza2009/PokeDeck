**The PokéDeck** is a multifunctional **pocket watch** packed with cool features for developers and tech lovers. Inspired by the GitHub Badger and styled like a Pokédex, its both **useful** and **fun**!

_I can't demo the PCB right now as I haven't gotten it yet so will be demoing the firmware instead! And yes the firmware will run without error on the PCB :). I have tested it on the Sprig with the Orpheus Pico!!_

It can be used to display your GitHub profile, play games, run timers, check sensor data, and carry a virtual pet! Powered by an **Orpheus Pico** (a custom **Raspberry Pi Pico**), the PokéDeck is open-source, rechargeable, and modular (kind of). It can be clipped to your bag, worn as a badge, or kept in your pocket!

# Hackamon: The OS Inside

![Hackamon Logo](https://cloud-7adfvs3rn-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0hackamon__1_.png)

**Hackamon** is a custom **virtual pet + OS** designed specifically for ~~a custom Tamagotchi~~ the PokéDeck (and tested on **Sprig** with an **Orpheus Pico**).  
Charge your Hackamon, play games, check your timers, and more — all with retro pixel-art charm (drawn by me!!).  
It's the heart of the PokéDeck.
