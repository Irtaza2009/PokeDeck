# PokéDeck

The PokéDeck is a multifunctional pocket tool for developers, makers, and tech lovers. Inspired by the GitHub Badger and styled like a Pokédex, it combines utility and fun. It showcases your info, GitHub profile, clock, Pomodoro timer, and even a simple Tic Tac Toe game. With built-in sensors like temperature, humidity, and an accelerometer, it’s your dev companion on the go.

Powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico, it’s fully open-source, rechargeable via a 400mAh LiPo, and optimized for low power thanks to its E-Ink display. You get haptic feedback, real-time LED alerts, modular expansion headers, and a tap-to-scan QR code mode to instantly share your portfolio. Whether on your desk, clipped to your shirt, or in your pocket, the PokéDeck is the ultimate digital-age badge.
